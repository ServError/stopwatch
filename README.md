stopwatch
=========

An ultra-simple HTML + JavaScript stopwatch app.

**simple.html** as the name suggests a *simple* **stopwatch**.

## Why?

Helping people learn how to code requires a simple but functional example app.

**Everyone** has experience using a stopwatch. Whether to time an experiement in science class, cooking in the home or holding ones' breath under water we can all immediately see the *use* of a stopwatch.

Yes, I hear you, "most mobile phones have stopwatches, why would anyone want to *build* their own?"
I agree, why ["re-invent the wheel"][] if you already have a perfectly good one?
Well, as you about to discover we are not re-inventing anything (*yet*!) simply *discovering* a few computer/web prgramming basics by building something we already know.
Once you have the basics mastered, I will show you how to unleash your imagination! :-)

## User Interface


![Stopwach Ready to Go](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/stopwatch/master/screenshots/Stopwatch-go.png "Simple Stopwatch Ready to Go!")

I tried to simplify the UI as much as possible so there is a single button/control for the stopwatch: **Go**
(If you chose to edit the file you can change this to *Start* or what ever you prefer)

![Stopwach Running](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/stopwatch/master/screenshots/Stopwatch-10hrs-running.png "Simple Stopwatch Running")

While the stopwatch is running we only have one action: **Stop**
(We can/will add the *Lap* function in a later tutorial bur for now *KISS*!)

![Stopwach stopped](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/stopwatch/master/screenshots/Stopwatch-10hrs-stopped.png "Simple Stopwatch Stopped")

When the "Stop" button is pressed/clicked it stops the timer.
We then have two options: we can either **Go** again to keep counting *or* **Clear**.
Clicking/Pressing the **Clear** button simply clears/resets the current count.
