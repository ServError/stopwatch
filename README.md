stopwatch
=========

An ultra-simple HTML + JavaScript stopwatch app.

**simple.html** is, as the name suggests a simple stopwatch.

I tried to simplify the UI as much as possible and have a single button/control for the stopwatch: "Go"
(If you chose to edit the file you can change this to "Start" or what ever you prefer)

While the stopwatch is running we only have one action: "Stop"

When the "Stop" button is pressed/clicked it stops the timer.
We then have two options: we can either "Go" again to keep counting or "Clear".
Clicking/Pressing the "Clear" button simply clears/resets the current count.
