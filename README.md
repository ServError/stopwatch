## Why?

Helping people learn how to code requires a *simple* but *functional* example.

**Everyone** has experience using a stopwatch.
Whether to time an experiment in school (science class),
cooking in the home or holding ones' breath under water,
we can all *immediately* see the *use* of a stopwatch.

Yes, I *hear* you, "most mobile phones have stopwatches,
why would anyone want to *build* their own?"  
I agree, why "***re-invent the wheel***" if you already have a perfectly good one?

Well, as you are about to discover we are not *re-inventing* anything (*yet*!) simply
*discovering* a few computer/web programming basics by building something we already know.

Once you have the basics mastered, you can unleash your imagination! :-)

## How?

Open the **index.html** in your web browser and try the **_simple_ stopwatch**.
Then read the code in the files to understand how it all works!


### User Interface


![Stopwach Ready to Go](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/137154873-ed4db4ff-a906-48e4-9b0f-49b6210aa6c1.png "Simple Stopwatch Ready to Go!")

I tried to simplify the UI as much as possible so there is a single button/control for the stopwatch: **Go**
(If you chose to edit the file you can change this to *Start* or what ever you prefer)

While the stopwatch is running we only have one action: **Stop**  
(We can/will add the *Lap* function in a later tutorial bur for now *KISS*!)

When the "Stop" button is pressed/clicked it stops the timer.  
We then have two options: we can either **Go** again to keep counting *or* **Clear**.  
Clicking/Pressing the **Clear** button simply clears/resets the current count.

you are re-inventing the wheel, show them these two links:
